## Motivation
Have you ever find it difficult to accomplish your goals? For example, starting revision early for your exams, submitting projects on time, eating healthy or exercising. We would tend to procrastinate or even forget about the goals that we wanted to achieve for ourselves. This can lead to undesirable consequences in the long run as these goals take a much longer time to complete or we set lower targets for ourselves instead.

Want more ways to organize your workflow and manage a wide range of projects? This app may be just what you need. It helps to manage every single thing in your life. The idea is, you clear everything out of your head—random ideas, household chores, errands, along with each task in your larger work projects—and put them in the app, so you won't worry about forgetting anything.

## Aim
We hope to help people to accomplish their goals on time, motivating them and supporting them on their journey.
