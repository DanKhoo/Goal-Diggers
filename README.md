## Aim
We want to help people to accomplish their goals on time, motivating them and supporting them on their journey.

## Project Scope
We want to help people to achieve their desired goals on time by giving timely reminders and motivation for them to pursue their goals. On top of that, we want them to be able to share their goals with their friends and vice versa, so that they can send encouragement to one another as well. This additional support would assist them in accomplishing what they have set out to do.

## Motivation
Have you ever find it difficult to accomplish your goals? For example, starting revision early for your exams, submitting projects on time, eating healthy or exercising. We would tend to procrastinate or even forget about the goals that we wanted to achieve for ourselves. This can lead to undesirable consequences in the long run as these goals take a much longer time to complete or we set lower targets for ourselves instead.

## User Stories
1) As a user, I want to login via Email & Passwords so that I can access my personal profile. 
2) As a user, I want to be able to add my goals in the application so that I can keep track of them.
3) As a user, I want to be able to update my goals so that I can change it or set it as completed. 
4) As a user, I want to be able to delete my goals so that I can delete completed goals.
5) As a user, I want to be reminded of my goals so that I can accomplish it on time.
6) As a user, I want to be notified with a motivational quote so that I can stay motivated in accomplishing my goals.
7) As a user, I want to be able to share my goals with my friends and also motivate them in theirs so that we can achieved our goals together.

## Proposed Features
**User App**
1) Authentication - login/register feature for users 
2) Basic CRUD - users to create/read/update/delete goals
3) Push notification - send reminder to users about incomplete goals depending on the frequency that user has set (e.g. Every 3 days) 
4) Push notification - send motivational quote to users every monday of the week 
5) Able to share goal with friends

Features written above will be ranked according to priority, from 1 - 3. 1 being highest, 3 being lowest.   
Priority 1 ==> Features 1 - 3   
Priority 2 ==> Feature 4    
Priority 3 ==> Feature 5    
Therefore, features will be implemented according to their priorities to allow us to achieve the minimum viable product.
